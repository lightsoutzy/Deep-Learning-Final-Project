        "This assignment contains two (2) questions and one (1) optional question for bonus marks. The questions and parts are wholly contained in this Google Colab Notebook. \n",
        "\n",
        "You are to make a copy of this Notebook and edit the copy to provide your answers/solutions. You are to complete the assignment entirely within Google Colab. Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "- It gives you practice using cloud-based interactive notebook environments (which is a popular workflow)\n",
        "- It is easier for you to manage the environment (e.g., installing packages, etc.)\n",
        "- Google Colab has nice, beefy machines, so you don't have to worry about running out of memory on your local computer.\n",
        "- It will be easier for the TA to help you debug your code if you need help\n",

        "- Use Python to complete the task.\n",
        "- You may use standard Python libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas,  numpy, transformers, and simpletransformers.\n",
        "- Tips:\n",
        "  - Submit code that runs without errors.\n",
        "  - Submit code that is reproducible. E.g., set random number seeds as appropriate. You should be able to run your code again and again and again, from the top of the file to the bottom of the file, and get the exact same results each time. I should be able to run your code, from scratch, again and again, and get the exact same results that you get.\n",
        "  - Submit code that is organized. Make your code readable. Provide comments to describe what the code is doing and why. Don’t leave “old” code lying around. Overall, if your code is clear and easy to read, then we will be happy. When we are happy, we give better marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "For tasks that require **text responses**:\n",
        "- Type your response in Notebook cell indicated.\n",
        "- Use English. Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Be professional and clear. Be complete, but not overly verbose.\n",
        "- Feel free to use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to format your answer (i.e., add bold, italics, lists, tables).\n",
        "- You may refer to your code in your answer. Please do so very clearly. E.g., “As can be seen in on line X above …“\n",
